<p>This plugin lets you easily push event notifications to any practical number of
web clients. To publish an event, content that includes a category and body is
posted to the &ldquo;publish&rdquo; URL configured in the Caddyfile. To subscribe to
published events, a web client simply connects to the &ldquo;subscribe&rdquo; URL
configured in the Caddyfile. This connection can be managed by including the
small, dependency-free file ps.js in your web application and using the
non-blocking methods of a Subscriber instance.</p>

<p>This plugin uses longpolling (specifically, <a href="https://github.com/jcuga/golongpoll">golongpoll</a>) to connect
clients to the server. The advantages of this are significant. Longpoll
connections</p>

<ul>
<li>are straightforward HTTP/HTTPS</li>
<li>are not thwarted by firewalls and proxies</li>
<li>are supported by virtually all browsers</li>
</ul>


<p>Additionally, this plugin provides a simple web-based interface to publish
events, so any software capable of posting content to the Caddy server, such as
wget and web browsers, can dispatch information to listening clients. This
flexibility allows short-lived applications, such as crontab scripts and CGI
scripts, to publish events that are of interest to subscribing web clients.</p>

<p>On the downside, longpoll connections are one-direction only. Published events
flow only from the server to clients. However, because of this plugin&rsquo;s simple
publishing interface, a web client that receives an event can immediately
publish its own response.</p>

<h2>Security Considerations</h2>

<p>As with websockets, longpolling requires special care to protect both the
server and all connected clients.</p>

<div class="warning"><p><strong>Longpolling consumes resources on the server.</strong> Too many connections to
clients can impact server operations. It is important to protect the
configured &ldquo;subscribe&rdquo; path with some form of authentication such as
<a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/basicauth">basic authentication</a> or <a href="https://github.com/BTBurke/caddy-jwt">JWT</a> in order to manage the number of
connections that your system will maintain. Be sure to use HTTPS!</p></div>

<div class="warning"><p><strong>Published events can instantly reach a large number of clients.</strong> Be sure
to require authorization in order to access the configured &ldquo;publish&rdquo; path to
prevent rogue publishers from dispatching unexpected content to clients or
flooding the subscription channels.</p></div>

<h2>Basic Syntax</h2>

<p>The basic pubsub directive lets you specify a &ldquo;publish&rdquo; path and a
corresponding &ldquo;subscribe&rdquo; path. This directive can be repeated. Each pubsub
block is managed by its own longpoll instance so categories are effectively
scoped by directive.</p>

<div class="syntax"><p><span class="key">pubsub</span> <span class="subkey">publish_path</span> <span class="subkey">subscribe_path</span></p></div>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>pubsub /chat/publish /chat/subscribe
</code></pre>

<p>The specified paths are virtual; they do not refer to any filesystem resources.</p>

<h3>Publishing</h3>

<p>When the Caddy server receives a call that matches the publish_path URL, the
pubsub plugin responds by checking the request for the url-encoded form fields
&ldquo;category&rdquo; and &ldquo;body&rdquo;. If these form values are sent to the server in a POST
request rather than included in the tail of the URL in a GET request, the
Content-Type must be &ldquo;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&rdquo;. The body value is
then dispatched verbatim to all clients that are currently subscribed to the
specified category. Structured data is easily dispatched by sending a
JSON-encoded value.</p>

<p>At its simplest, a publish call might look like</p>

<pre><code>https://example.com/chat/publish?category=team&amp;body=Hello%20world
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, the body &ldquo;Hello world&rdquo; is dispatched to all subscribers of the
&ldquo;team&rdquo; category.</p>

<h3>Subscribing</h3>

<p>When the Caddy server receives a call that matches the subscribe_path URL, the
pubsub plugin keeps the connection alive until a publication event of the
correct category is returned or the configured time limit is reached. In either
case, the client then makes another similar request of the server. This cycle
continues until the client page is dismissed. When the longpoll instance
detects that the client is no longer responsive it gracefully drops the client
from its subscription list.</p>

<h2>Advanced Syntax</h2>

<p>The basic syntax shown above is likely all you will need to configure the
pubsub plugin. If some control over the underlying golongpoll package is
needed, you can use all or part of the advanced syntax shown here.</p>

<div class="syntax"><p><span class="key">pubsub</span> <span class="subkey">publish_path</span> <span class="subkey">subscribe_path</span> {
 <span class="key">MaxLongpollTimeoutSeconds</span> <span class="subkey">timeout</span>
 <span class="key">MaxEventBufferSize</span> <span class="subkey">count</span>
 <span class="key">EventTimeToLiveSeconds</span> <span class="subkey">timeout</span>
 <span class="key">DeleteEventAfterFirstRetrieval</span>
}</p></div>

<p>Any missing fields are replaced with their default values; see the
<a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/jcuga/golongpoll">golongpoll documentation</a> for more details.</p>

<p>The <code>MaxLongpollTimeoutSeconds</code> subdirective specifies the maximum number of
seconds that the longpoll server will keep a client connection alive.</p>

<p>The <code>MaxEventBufferSize</code> subdirective specifies the maximum number of events of
a particular category that will be kept by the longpoll server. Beyond this
limit, events will be dropped even if they have not expired.</p>

<p>The <code>EventTimeToLiveSeconds</code> subdirective specifies how long events will be
retained by the longpoll server.</p>

<p>If the <code>DeleteEventAfterFirstRetrieval</code> subdirective is present then events
will be deleted right after they have been dispatched to current subscribers.</p>

<h2>Running the example</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Obtain or build a Caddy web server with the pubsub plugin.</p></li>
<li><p>Create an example directory and download the files in the repository
<a href="https://github.com/jung-kurt/caddy-pubsub/tree/master/example">example</a> directory to it. Make this your default working directory.</p></li>
<li><p>Edit the file named Caddyfile. Modify the site address to an
appropriate local network address. Ideally, you will use an address that can be
accessed from a number of devices on your network. (A local interface, such as
127.0.0.5, will work, but then you will have to simulate multiple devices by
opening multiple tabs in your browser.) You may wish to use a non-standard port
if you need to avoid interfering with another server. HTTP is used here for the
purposes of a local, insecure demonstration. <strong>Use HTTPS in production.</strong> The
Caddyfile has values for the authorization fields and paths that are used as
defaults in the example script, so leaving them as they are will simplify the
demonstration.</p></li>
<li><p>Launch the Caddy web server from the directory that contains your example
Caddyfile. The command might be simply <code>caddy</code> or, if the caddy executable you
wish to run is not on the default search path, you will need to qualify the
name with its location.</p></li>
<li><p>Access the server with the web browsers of a number of devices.
Alternatively, open a number of tabs in a single browser and point them to the
server.</p></li>
<li><p>On each open page, click the &ldquo;Configure&rdquo; button and make appropriate changes.
Most fields, such as &ldquo;Auth password&rdquo; and &ldquo;URL&rdquo; are pre-filled to match the
values in the sample Caddyfile. You may enter a name in the &ldquo;Publisher name&rdquo;
field or leave it empty. A blank value will be replaced with a random name like
&ldquo;user_42&rdquo; the first time you publish an event.</p></li>
<li><p>On each open page, click the &ldquo;Run&rdquo; button and then the &ldquo;Start&rdquo; button.
Simulate the publication of events by clicking the &ldquo;A&rdquo;, &ldquo;B&rdquo;, and &ldquo;C&rdquo; buttons
from various devices or tab pages. These events will be sent to the web server
and dispatched to all subscribing pages. These events will be displayed beneath
the buttons in a list. A page can publish events even if it does not subscribe
to them.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Using pubsub in your own web applications</h2>

<p>The JavaScript file ps.js is included in the example shown above. This script
may be included in a web page with the following line:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="ps.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The script is small and dependency-free and should be easy to modify if needed.
Within your application code, instantiate a Subscriber instance as follows:</p>

<pre><code>subscribe = ps.Subscriber(category, url, callback, authorization);
</code></pre>

<p>The parameters are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>category</strong>: a short string that identifies the event category to which to
subscribe</p></li>
<li><p><strong>url</strong>: the subscribe_path configured in the Caddyfile (in the example above,
this is &ldquo;/psdemo/subscribe&rdquo;)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>callback</strong>: this is a function that is called (with the published body and
server timestamp) for each event of the specified category</p></li>
<li><p><strong>authorization</strong>: a string like &ldquo;Basic c3Vic2NyaWJlOjEyMw==&rdquo; that will be
sent as an authorization header.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>More details can be found in the comments in the ps.js file.</p>

<p>To start the subscription, call</p>

<pre><code>subscribe.start();
</code></pre>

<p>To end the subscription, call</p>

<pre><code>subscribe.stop();
</code></pre>

<p>Publish an event as follows:</p>

<pre><code>ps.publish(category, url, body, authorization);
</code></pre>

<p>The parameters are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>category</strong>: a short string that identifies the event category of the
published event</p></li>
<li><p><strong>url</strong>: the publish_path configured in the Caddyfile (in the example above,
this is &ldquo;/psdemo/publish&rdquo;)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>body</strong>: this is the text that will be dispatched to all subscribers of
events with the specified category; this text is often a JSON-encoded object</p></li>
<li><p><strong>authorization</strong>: a string like &ldquo;Basic cHVibGlzaDoxMjM=&rdquo; that will be sent
as an authorization header.</p></li>
</ul>
